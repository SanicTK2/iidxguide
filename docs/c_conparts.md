## What should I get?

### Buttons

Buttons practically last forever, so they are a good long-term investment. They also play a large role in the "feel". Cheap buttons are prone to getting stuck.

{: .image_container }

Sanwa buttons (from Japan) feel the best, but can be expensive. This is the arcade standard. They come with Omron switches by default.

Samduck-sa buttons (from Korea) feel very, very close to Sanwa buttons, at a fraction of the cost. Most Korean arcades use these buttons. Some at-home players swear by these. Samduck-sa buttons can use the same springs as Sanwa buttons. These come with Gersung switches by default.

DJ DAO buttons and other Chinese-manufactured buttons feel very different from Sanwas. They often have slightly different internal dimensions, which means Sanwa springs will not fit (usually the springs will be too long to fit). They are also very cheap. These usually come built-in by default when controllers are purchased.

### Switches and springs

For most players, **50g Omron switch + 50N spring**, or **50g Omron switch + 20N spring** setup is recommended - [more details here](/intermediate/switchspring).

#### Switches

{: .image_container }

Omron switches (from Japan) are the arcade standard.

[![gersung switch](/assets/img/parts/gersung.jpg)](/assets/img/parts/gersung.jpg)
{: .image_container }

Gersung switches (from Korea) are cheaper alternatives to Omrons. The downsides are that they do not last as long, and only comes in 45g weight.

Honeywell and other no-name switches are heavily recommended against; they are too light and/or prone to failure.

#### Springs

Compared to button and switch quality, springs play a relatively minor role in the "feel", but they still do make a small difference.

{: .image_container }

Sanwa springs (from Japan) are the arcade standard, but can be expensive and difficult to obtain, depending on the weight.

IST mall springs (no-name) are much cheaper, but they tend to be a bit inconsistent (each spring can be heavier or lighter than another, even though they are supposed to be the same weight). They are also slightly shorter, which makes the buttons sink a little lower.

## LED Lamps

[![LED lamps](/assets/img/parts/led.jpg)](/assets/img/parts/led.jpg)
{: .image_container }

Most controllers will come with LED lamps built into the buttons. You can pull them out and transfer them to other buttons - e.g., if you bought a DAO controller with DAO buttons, you can pull out the LEDs and insert them into Sanwa or Samduck buttons.

Arcade LEDs operate at 12V, most home controllers like DJ DAO operate at 5V. YuanCon is a notable exception which uses 12V.

Some LED lamps work with both. Some only work with 5V, or only with 12V.

## How do I know what I have?

If you have an Omron switch, it's written on the switch casing. Here is a cheat sheet:

* D2MV-01-1C1 = 10g
* D2MV-01-1C2 = 25g
* D2MV-01-1C3 = 50g (old LM standard)
* VX-01-1C23 = 50g (new LM standard as of CastHour)
* V-10-1A4 = 100g
* V-15-1A5 = 200g

Spring weights are harder. If you don't know:

* Stock Sanwa buttons ship with V-10-1A4 (100g) switches and 100N springs.
* Stock Dao buttons are 20g Honeywell switches and 40N springs.
* Stock Samduck buttons ship with 45g Gersung switches 20N-30N springs. YMMV as they occasionally switch up the defaults. The only way to know is call Samduck-sa store and ask.

These are official images for Sanwa springs. You can try to tell them apart by the density and the color (e.g., 60N springs are heat-treated, therefore darker).

## Where do I buy them?

Make sure you check the price and factor in the shipping cost to your country!

Notes:

* In the past, Rakuten had an international storefront which allowed foreign buyers to access the Sanwa Denshi shop. This has been shut down in 2020, so you now need a shipping proxy to receive items within Japan and have someone ship them out to you. Buyee is one such option.
* ISTMall will ship international. If you have trouble with the website, try Internet Explorer (no, not Edge, Internet Explorer, really). Sometimes they sell out of parts, and get restocked months later.
* DJ DAO's storefront charges a lot of money for shipping small things.

### Sanwa Buttons

It is recommended that you buy the ones without LEDs, since they are much cheaper. If you do buy the ones with LEDs, note that they are meant to be used with 12V.

These are the "old lamp holder" design (vs. new "integrated" design), which is more commonly used in arcade and home controllers.

Sanwa buttons come with V-10-1A4 (100g) switches and 100N Sanwa springs.

### Samduck-sa buttons

Stock Samduck buttons ship with 45g Gersung switches 20N-30N springs. YMMV as they occasionally switch up the defaults. The only way to know is call Samduck-sa store and ask. You can always swap in Omron switches and Sanwa springs. These do not include LED lamps but are compatible with DAO lamps and ISTMall lamps.
