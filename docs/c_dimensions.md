Measured from the right edge of 1P button 7 to left edge of 2P button 1 - it should be **19.0cm**. The edge starts where the button holder (black plastic) ends.

## Old cabinets

The drawing above is from Korean cab manual from Uniana. Numbers called out should be the same as Japanese cabs (the only real difference is the monitor size, height, and distance).

[This video is also a good resources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fDNC8ygWzE) explaining dimensions of the old cab.
