## Disclaimer

Everyone is off by plus or minus a few centimeters, including this page. People use slightly different start / end points when measuring. Use it as an approximate guidance and not exact measurements.

## Height from bass platform to keys

The height from top of the bass platform to the button panel is **90cm**. It is the same for both Lightning Model cabinets and the old cabs.

When you are playing at the arcade, you would have shoes on (hopefully), but when you are playing at home, you may not be wearing any shoes. This means you may need to compensate by having your home setup a few centimeters lower.

## Height from bass platform to judgement line

On old cabs, distance from top of the bass platform to the red judgement line is about **127cm-130cm**. This depends on model of the monitor of course, which varies depending on the cab.

On lightning model cabs - this has not yet been accurately measured, but it seems to be slightly higher than on the old cabs.

## [DP] Distance between 1P and 2P

Important number for DP players - how far apart are the keys?

![DP distance between keys is 19cm](/assets/img/dp_distance.png)

Measured from the right edge of 1P button 7 to left edge of 2P button 1 - it should be **19.0cm**. The edge starts where the button holder (black plastic) ends.

## [SP] Distance of controller from the center

For SP players -- using the above measurement, we can derive that:

* Rightmost edge of 1P button 7 (or leftmost edge of 2P button 1) is **9.5cm** away from the horizontal center of the screen.

This assumes that you are using the same size monitor as the arcade, though. If your screen is smaller, you'll want to move a little closer to the middle.

## Lightning Model details

* These are approximate numbers based on a drawing on the official manual.
* Screen is a 43" - [see this page](/compendium/infinitas_monitor) for more about monitors. In reality, the visible area is a bit smaller, little bit over 42".
* Roughly speaking, center of each turntable align with edges of the main monitor.
* Keys to center of the screen is about 49.3cm.
* Keys to bottom fo the screen is about 22.8cm.
* Bass platform to keys is about 90cm, same as old cabinet.
* Depth from front end of control panel to screen is about 66.7cm. Note that lightning cab does not have the black leather-bound cushion part on the front.

## Old cabinet details

[This page](http://jahhoo.ldblog.jp/archives/17971701.html) has measurements taken from an old cabinet.

* Bass platform is 10cm.
* Bass platform to key panel is 90cm.
* For LCD cabs, key panel (measured from wood, not acrylic panel) to bottom of monitor is 23.5cm.

The drawing above is from Korean cab manual from Uniana. Key measurements should be mostly the same, with an exception that Uniana cabs tend to use larger monitors that are farther back and slightly higher up.
