## Normal Hi-Speed

Normal hi-speed is the default option as of BISTROVER. It is a good option for beginners. It is BPM-independent, and ranges from 1 to 20.

## Classic hi-Speed

Classic hi-speed is an option that is not accessible by default. It is a legacy option that can be enabled through the eamusement website. This is a BPM-dependent hi-speed option that was available beatmania IIDX in older versions instead of the normal hi-speed.

## Floating Hi-Speed

Floating hi-speed is the mode that almost everyone uses. You should be using this option! FHS allows you to set a constant scroll speed at the precise rate, and it carries from song to song. It also has some other nice side benefits that will need some elaboration - [check out this page for full details on how to use FHS.](/b_fhs.html)
