## How to hit stairs in DP?

There are various ways to hit stairs in DP, but we can summarize these into 3 methods.

Let me explain this with right hand. (Thumb / Index / Middle / Ring / Pinky to buttons 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 )

### Base position type

Thumb - Index - Thumb/Index - Middle - Ring - Ring - Pinky

### Middle-5 type

Thumb - Index - Thumb - Index - Middle - Ring - Pinky

(You can watch an excellent example [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX05hoa_exA). Check 1:40)

### Middle-6 type

Thumb - Index - Thumb - Middle - Ring - Middle - Pinky

When you hit 3, it’s natural to use your thumb rather than using your index finger.

But you should practice your index finger to hit 3 when your thumb is occupied.

## Efficient use of your middle fingers

Many DP players recommend beginners to be familiar with [base position](/dp/intro_by_chicken).

Base position means that 

* hold your thumb / middle / pinky on 1 / 4 / 7
* and move your index / ring to 2-3 / 5-6

This position lets your finger movement to a minimum, because you mostly move your index / pinky away from the base position. It results high efficiency when it comes to hitting notes; this is sufficient to reach DP kaiden without any issues.

But these "pill" shaped notes (aka Dr. Mario), especially 5+6 pills have started to be included in charts since Rootage. As a result you'd better practice middle finger to aide your ring finger. Moving your middle finger to 5 or 6 requires a lot of practice. You can use the base position in most cases, but try to use middle-5 or middle-6 when you encounter stairs - even if you are a beginner.

*This opinion is controversial.

I think beginners should practice using the middle finger to hit 5 and/or 6. DP already has a steep learning curve in the beginning. Either way, There would be tons of players who quit playing DP not long after starting.

Some players believe that beginners should focus on getting interested in playing DP first (and not focus too much on finger techniques), and think that skilled players should not be teach difficult methods to DP beginners.

## Various kinds of stairs

You will encounter various types of stairs when you are progressing through the game. When you are around level 10, you can often meet some of these below.

In the higher levels, there are some advanced stairs that may drive you nuts. Usually you won't find these in level 10s and lower, but they do show up occasionally.

## How to practice stairs

In my experience, you can often encounter same-colored stairs around level 10 or lower. Of course, there are a few songs which advanced patterns comes out even at those lower levels.

The higher levels that you reach, more common it will be to encounter advanced stair patterns. Difficult stairs are often hand-in-hand with overall difficulty of a chart.

**\* The best way to practice these patterns is trying them in low FREQ option and speed up to hit them in higher FREQ option.** -- but this requires you to be playing an an environment that supports slowing down of charts (BMS, or CS practice mode). If that isn't possible, you can try them in level 10 or lower charts.

*Using FREQ is a good temporary way to "reset" yourself away from falling into bad habits. [Read this for more details](/dp/silent_kuse).

Here are my recommendations in AC which are around level 10 or lower. Songs marked with +++ can be difficult.

**Level 10**

* avant-guerre +++
* Arcana +++
* BRAVE GLOW
