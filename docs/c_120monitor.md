## Disclaimers

Updated May 2021.

This is a list of monitors and TVs that meet the following criteria:
* Native 120hz+ panel and supports 120hz input
* 39" diagonal or larger
* 16:9 aspect ratio
* flat, not curved

All currency in USD. Always read third party reviews (like **rtings**) before buying them. This is especially important for TVs, since some TVs will falsely advertise as having 120hz but in reality their smaller size models use a different panel and only support 60hz. This is very common with Samsung products.

Also common to see them using interpolation to lie about their refresh rate (e.g., "motion rate" or "effective rate") when in reality the panel does not natively display 120hz input.

Features that do not affect IIDX or BMS simulators will not be explicitly called out; such as FreeSync, G-Sync, HDR, and so on.

## Lightning Model display

For reference, [according to this page](https://land3939.info/mgame/1148), Lightning Model cabs use the following primary display:

* Manufactuer: [GTT](http://gtt.co.kr/en/?ckattempt=1)
* Model: TLK-4300
* 43" VA panel at native 1080p 120hz.
* Cab uses 1600x900@120hz over DisplayPort (the game is 720p however, so it's upscaled to 900p)
