# Welcome to iidx.org

This is a guide written mainly for new players getting into beatmania IIDX. Over time more advanced topics may be added.

This is part of an effort to provide a friendly introduction to the game for the English-speaking audience. Too much of English-language IIDX content is:

* not friendly to beginners new to the game,
* too verbose, documenting the entire history of IIDX instead of focusing on the current version,
* extremely outdated, or
* locked up behind walled-garden communities like members-only websites and Discord servers

This guide aims to resolve these issues by pulling from various *established* resources written in other languages (mostly Japanese and Korean), with a bit of original English content as well. References will be provided whenever possible.

The guide assumes that you are either playing on:
 * beatmania IIDX Infinitas (2020 version)
 * beatmania IIDX 28 BISTROVER 

Infinitas-specific sections will be denoted with [INF], and arcade-specific sections will have [AC].
