# Beginners

A section for beginners just starting out, appropriate if you are currently playing SP level 8 or below.

Take your time! You don't need to absorb of this information at once. As you progress through levels 1 to 8, you'll start to have questions like - what does this option menu do? How do I fix my timing? What's the best way to change the scroll speed? What is this "green number" and "random" that people always talk about?

The goal of this section is twofold:
1. Equip you with tools to navigate through the game
1. Help you get on the right foot on a path to getting better at the game.
