## Standard

![song select](/assets/img/song_select.jpg)

This is the most commonly played game mode on AC.

You can play three songs, plus a potential 4th song in Extra Stage, plus a potential 5th song in One More Extra Stage.

You are not guaranteed three songs, however. If you fail to clear the song, you do not advance to the next stage. Exception is given to the first stage - if you fail a song that is level 5 or under, you can still advance to the second stage.

Same song cannot be chosen more than once.

### Level Limitations

There are limitations to what difficulty charts you can pick in Standard play. The table below shows the highest difficulty chart you can pick under certain conditions.

<table class="center_table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>DAN Class</th>
      <th>Play Count</th>
      <th>1st STAGE</th>
      <th>2nd STAGE</th>
      <th>FINAL STAGE<br class="spacer">EXTRA STAGE</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>None-5th Dan</td>
      <td rowspan="3">-</td>
      <td>LEVEL 8</td>
      <td rowspan="2">LEVEL 10</td>
      <td rowspan="6">No restrictions</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6th Dan</td>
      <td>LEVEL 9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7th Dan</td>
      <td colspan="2">LEVEL 10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="2">8th Dan and above</td>
      <td>Under 100</td>
      <td>LEVEL 10</td>
      <td>LEVEL 11</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>100 or more</td>
      <td colspan="2">LEVEL 11</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10th Dan and above</td>
      <td>1000 or more</td>
      <td rowspan="2" colspan="2">No restrictions</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Kiwami Kaiden</td>
      <td>800 or more</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Extra Stage

To enter Extra Stage, certain conditions must be met in the final stage. These are the requirements that hold true since Happy Sky.

<table class="center_table">
    <tr>
        <th>Level</th>
        <th>SP Requirement</th>
        <th>DP Requirement</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td rowspan=4>ALL GREAT clear</td>
        <td rowspan=3>ALL GREAT clear</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td rowspan=2>FULL COMBO clear</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td rowspan=2>FULL COMBO clear</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>Clear with 100% gauge</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>Clear with 100% gauge</td>
        <td rowspan=6>Clear (Assist Easy gauge or above)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>8</td>        
        <td rowspan=5>Clear (Assist Easy gauge or above)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>11</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>12</td>
    </tr>
</table>

There are important regional differences to note:

* In Japan region, PASELI must be used as the form of payment when entering Standard mode in order to enter extra stage. (In other words, coin play cannot enter extra stage)
  * This includes old IIDX cabs at American Round 1, which are on the Japanese eamuse network and PASELI cannot be used.
* In Asia region and America region (including Lightning Model cabs at American Round 1), Extra Stage can be entered even on coin play, as PASELI is unavailable.

Additional notes:

* Any option can be used - assist options like EXPAND JUDGE or H-RANDOM.
* If two people are playing at the same time, only one player needs to meet the requirement.

### Event Extra Stage / One More Extra stage

Special Extra stage and One More Extra stage can also be accessed during events. The requirements depend on the active event.

## Free Modes

Free mode is visually similar to Standard mode, but is less restrictive when it comes to what songs you can play, at higher cost to you (or fewer songs).

Notable differences from Standard:

* Same song can be chosen multiple times.
* No restrictions on the difficulty level.
* Extra Stage events cannot be accessed.

There are many variations:

### Free

Selectable from Mode Select. Two songs are guaranteed.

### Free Plus

Selectable from Mode Select if two players are active. Three songs are guaranteed.

### Time Free / Time Free Plus

Only active on certain day of the week - replaces Free / Free Plus. Instead of guaranteed song count, you are given a time limit of 5 minutes (7 on Plus).

### Hazard

![hazard](/assets/img/mode_hazard.jpg)

In Mode Select, if you press all three black keys, you can switch to Hazard mode. You are guaranteed four songs, but you play on Hazard gauge which immediately fails you out if you lose a combo. EXPAND JUDGE is disabled.

### Time Hazard

Only active on certain day of the week - replaces Hazard with a 8 minute timer.

### Time Hell

Only active on certain day of the week - similar to Time Hazard (8 minute timer), but you play on Time Hell guage, which is a hard or ex-hard gauge that never refills during a song.

## Premium Free

![pfree](/assets/img/mode_pfree.jpg)

PASELI only mode. You are given a time limit, but you can play any number of songs without restrictions. This tends to be the most expensive option, but the most flexible way to play.

## Step-Up

![step up](/assets/img/mode_stepup.jpg)

Three songs are guaranteed, but sometimes you can play four. This is a "training" mode that also has a story.

### Step-up folder

20 random charts are provided in this folder that matches your current step-up skill level. If you clear a song, the step-up skill increases and you are given more difficult charts; if you fail, you are given easier charts. If you clear a song with high DJ LEVEL (AAA) then you can greatly increase the skill level.

There is no penalty for EXPAND-JUDGE.

### Review folder(s)

![step up review](/assets/img/mode_stepup_review.jpg)

There are up to twelve folders for each level. You can only open folders that are 1 level below the current step-up level. It contains songs that you have **already played in other modes**, with the following restrictions:

* New songs from the current version will not show up. This restriction is eventually removed at the end of the version's lifecycle.
* You must have EX-SCORE greater than 0 on it already.
* You must have the song unlocked.
* Songs played in class mode does not count as they save as "NO PLAY", even if you have greater than 0 EX-SCORE.

Regional differences to note:

* On Japanese network using coin play, or on old cabs at American Round 1, you are limited to [current level - 2] folders. In other words, there is no way to play songs harder than 10.
  * On PASELI play or in Asia / America regions, this restriction does not exist.

## Class

![dan mode](/assets/img/mode_dan.jpg)

Class mode (dan-i-nintei) measures your skill level by playing through a pre-defined course of four songs, and awards you with a badge of honor.

[Remywiki](https://remywiki.com/Beatmania_IIDX_Dan_Courses) has a very good explanation of the mode and the songs in each version.

## Arena

![arena](/assets/img/mode_arena.png)

Online battle mode, or local matching (within the same store) are available. Four stages are guaranteed.

You enter a lobby with up to four players - if there are fewer than four, you are matched up with bots. Each player picks a song, and the lobby plays through four songs.

If you are not matched at least one person, you are given the option to enter TIME FREE instead.

## Daily bonuses

Each day of the week provides a bonus. All time is based on Japan time.
