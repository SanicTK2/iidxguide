## General

### statistik (English)

### remywiki (English)

### FOV Calculator

[https://andyf.me/fovcalc.html](https://andyf.me/fovcalc.html)

This is used to calculate FOV values for various racing games, but it can also be used to figure out the screen distance for your home IIDX / BMS setup, in case your monitor is smaller or larger than cab monitors.

For example, Lightning Model cabs have (approximately) [42" monitor at 67cm away from bottom edge of the control deck](/cab_dimensions), which gives RBR value of 0.960. To get an equivalent experience with a 32" monitor, you would put the screen at 51cm away.
