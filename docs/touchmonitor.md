## Touch screen monitors

Here is a list of small-ish (20"-27") touch screen monitors and their sample rate (poll time) measured with [mouserate application](https://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Mouse-Rate-Checker.shtml#:~:text=Mouse%20Rate%20Checker%20is%20a%20lightweight%20piece%20of,are%20using%20tools%20or%20games%20with%20high-frame%20rates.).

You want at least 200Hz for rhythm games to be playable, but in reality, higher the better. For general application usage, you want something around 100Hz for a good tablet-like experience, but 60Hz is fine too if you are not too picky.

Note that this is just based on user data, there is no guarantee that a model manufactured on a certain date uses a specific touch controller - your mileage may vary.

And of course, IR touch screen sensors are also a thing, but they are not covered here.
