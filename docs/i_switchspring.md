## Introduction

Before we begin, it is worth calling out that this is an **opinion piece** by the author. Button weight has been a hot topic for the longest time, and even today, players are torn on what the right set up is. The "meta" has changed over the years. This article was written in May of 2021.

## Recommendation

Assuming you are using Sanwa buttons,

**If you prefer a heavier set up, or if you want the stock arcade experience, use 50g switches (Omron D2MV-01-1C3) and 50N springs.**

This is the set up I recommend to most players. 50N springs are not easy to get, so 40N springs are fine too. 60N springs are a bit heavier, but it'll do if that's all you can find.

**If you prefer a lighter set up, use 50g switches (Omron D2MV-01-1C3) and 20N springs.**

If you play a lot of high level SP 12s, or insane BMS, or if you play DP, you'll most likely prefer the light setup.

*Other buttons (Samduck-sa, and no name Chinese buttons) will have a different feeling even with the same switch and spring. Here, we will only talk about Sanwa buttons, which is the standard.*

## Justification

Why are 50/50 and 50/20 configurations recommended? 

### Justification for 50/50

* This is the new official default. This set up is used on new Lightning Model cabs, and required by official tournaments run by Konami.
* All Lightning Model cabs in America are 50/50.
* Most Lightning Model cabs in Japan are 50/50.
* Compared to 50/20, it provides sufficient feedback when released, making it easier to time, handling jacks, and so on.

### Justification for 50/20

* Compared to 50/50, it requires significantly less force to push down, making it ideal for extremely high density charts or DP players.
  * But it's worth noting that many DP top rankers prefer the default 50/50 configuration.
* It is not too light; the 50g switch still provides sufficient amount of tactile feedback.
* Most cabs in Korea are 50/20, including Lightning Model cabs.

## Why a 50g switch and not 25g?

25g switches (D2MV-01-1C2) are also commonly used, but here, I'm recommending the 50g switches. This is because lighter switches have a shorter life span and require more maintenance.

While Omron claims on the spec sheet that they have identical electrical and mechanical lifespan, the guaranteed lifespan is far, far shorter compared to how much abuse it takes inside a IIDX controller. So the claimed lifespan on the spec sheet is meaningless in our context.

But if you ended up getting 25g switches anyway, they are totally fine. You can achieve a similar feeling by matching the total actuation force, which can be done with slightly heavier springs. For example, 25g switch + 60N Springs is very similar to 50g switch + 20N springs, although advanced users can probably tell the difference. The biggest difference comes from the tactile feeling; 50g switches have a much more prominent *clicky* feeling than 25g.

That being said, matching 50/50 setup is difficult with 25g switches; 100N springs are a bit too heavy, and you can't really find any springs between 60N And 100N.

## What set up do I have???

If you have an Omron switch, it's written on the switch casing. Here is a cheat sheet:

* D2MV-01-1C2 = 25g
* D2MV-01-1C3 = 50g
* V-10-1A4 = 100g

Spring weights are harder. If you don't know:

* Stock Sanwa buttons ship with V-10-1A4 (100g) switches and 100N springs.
* Stock Dao buttons are 20g Honeywell switches and 40N springs.
* Stock Samduck buttons ship with 45g Gersung switches 20N-30N springs. YMMV as they occasionally switch up the defaults. The only way to know is call Samduck-sa store and ask.
