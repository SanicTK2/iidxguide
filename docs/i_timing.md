## How do I know my timing?

If you haven't already, follow [the instructions here](/beginner/option2#timing-display-fastslow) to enable real time FAST / SLOW display. It is helpful to place it right above your judgement display, but feel free to move it elsewhere if you find it too distracting.

Additionally, make it a habit to check out the FAST / SLOW section in the result screen.

If you are playing BISTROVER on the lightning model cabinet, the touch screen display has fine-grained breakdown of your timing information as well, if you tap on the "Player Analyze" menu.

## How do I fix my timing?

If your timing feels *significantly* off, you should fix your green number first before adjusting offset. If you feel the timing is slightly off, then you can fine-tune using the offset feature.

When you are calibrating your timing, play a chart that meets these criteria:

1. a song you are familiar with
1. a relatively easy chart, compared to your peak playing level
1. not heavy on scratches

You should avoid charts that are too easy or too hard when trying to dial in your settings.

Some recommend songs around levels 7-8:
* Element of SPADA (7/9)
* Fly Above (8)
* Shining World (8/9)
* DAYDREAMER (8/10)
* Mermaid Girl (8/10)

### Step one - adjust your green number

If you are getting too many FASTs, this is easily fixable! Consider reducing your green number (make notes go faster). The explanation for this is that, if have too much time to react to a note coming down, you may tend to hit too quickly. By reducing the green number, there will be a smaller window between the moment you read the notes and the moment you press the buttons.

If you are getting way too many SLOWs, you may not be having enough time to react. Increase your green number (make notes go slower) and see if it helps.

Don't use a green number that is too high or too low. When it is extremely low, you are playing purely on reaction speed, which has severe (negative) impact on timing. When it is extremely high, you are giving your brain too much time to process the notes, which leads to inconsistent timing. A typical GN range is between 260 and 300.

Once you find a green number you are comfortable with, stick with it. Try to keep the same one for at least a few sessions. Avoid changing it mid-session.

### Step two - fix your offset

[Use the offset setting in the blue menu to change your visual offset.](/beginner/option2#offset-adjustment)

Don't fiddle with this too much. Once you find a good offset for the environment you play on (particular arcade cabinet or your PC), try to keep the same offset for a while and see if you can get adjust to it.

## What about white number?

[Some say that having a large lane cover (high white number) is not ideal, as it "compresses" the notes together](https://the-safari.com/3103), making it difficult to tell them apart. If you are playing with a white number higher than 500, you might want to experiment with making the lane cover shorter.

That is just one opinion - you should find a white number that you are comfortable with.

There are valid reasons for very high white numbers -- one of them being playing on a display with severe ghosting problems, which can be remedied by a high WN. In that case... sorry, not much you can do there.
