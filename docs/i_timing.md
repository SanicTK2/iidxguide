## How do I know my timing?

If you haven't already, follow [the instructions here](/beginners/option2#timing-display-fastslow) to enable real time FAST / SLOW display. It is helpful to place it right above your judgement display, but feel free to move it elsewhere if you find it too distracting.

Additionally, make it a habit to check out the FAST / SLOW section in the result screen.

If you are playing BISTROVER on the lightning model cabinet, the touch screen display has fine-grained breakdown of your timing information as well, if you tap on the "Player Analyze" menu.

## How do I fix my timing?

If your timing feels *significantly* off, you should fix your green number first before adjusting offset. If you feel the timing is slightly off, then you can fine-tune using the offset feature.

When you are calibrating your timing, play a chart that meets these criteria:

1. a song you are familiar with
1. a relatively easy chart, compared to your peak playing level
1. not heavy on scratches

Recommend songs:
* Fly Above
* Shining World
* DAYDREAMER
* Element of SPADA
* Mermaid Girl

### Adjust your green number first

If you are getting too many FASTs, this is easily fixable! Consider reducing your green number (make notes go faster). The explanation for this is that, if have too much time to react to a note coming down, you may tend to hit too quickly. By reducing the green number, there will be a smaller window between the moment you read the notes and the moment you press the buttons. At least in theory, anyway -- don't use a green number that is too low.

If you are getting way too many SLOWs, you may not be having enough time to react. Increase your green number (make notes go slower) and see if it helps.

### Fix your offset last

[Use the offset setting in the blue menu to change your visual offset.](/beginners/option2#offset-adjustment)

Don't fiddle with this too much. Once you find a good offset for the environment you play on (particular arcade cabinet or your PC), try to keep the same offset for a while and see if you can get adjust to it.

## Other tips to improve timing

### Horizontal reading

**Horizontal reading is a very important topic that warrants an essay of its own**. [I recommend that you read this article](https://the-japari.tumblr.com/post/166760567060/horizontal-and-vertical-reading) and internalize it forever.

### Eyesight

Take some time to consider where on the screen you are looking. Ideally, your sight is fixed at one location on the screen; you should not be drifting up and down. If you can keep your reading to one area of the screen, your timing will improve.

### What about white number?

[Having a large lane cover (high white number) is not ideal, as it "compresses" the notes together](https://the-safari.com/3103), making it difficult to tell them apart. If you are playing with a white number higher than 500, you might want to experiment with making the lane cover shorter.

(There are valid reasons for very high white numbers -- one of them being playing on a display with severe ghosting problems, which can be remedied by a high WN. In that case... sorry, not much you can do there)

### Your conditions matter

This might seem obvious, but it does need to be called out. Some days, you are tired, so you hit a lot of SLOWs. Other days, you're hyped up on caffeine, so you hit a lot more FASTs thanks to your heightened reaction time. Since IIDX has a very tight timing window, this makes a lot more of a difference than you think! This doesn't directly help you with improving your timing, but it's something to keep in mind. Maybe your green number and offset are totally fine, maybe you're just a bit tired today.

## [INF] Ensure your PC's audio latency isn't too high

If you are playing at home, you might first one to confirm that your audio output does not have a significant delay. A good way to check this is to use a [test video like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucZl6vQ_8Uo).

![inf audio settings](/assets/img/infinitas_audio.png)

Double check that you're using exclusive WASAPI setting and not shared mode -- this is configurable in the game's launcher. See the image above.

There are other ways to reduce audio latency on a Windows PC, but this page will not go into detail, since it is very hardware dependent. Just gotta search online for answers and experiment on your own.
