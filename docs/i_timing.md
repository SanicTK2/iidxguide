## How do I know my timing?

If you haven't already, follow [the instructions here](/beginner/option2#timing-display-fastslow) to enable real time FAST / SLOW display. It is helpful to place it right above your judgement display, but feel free to move it elsewhere if you find it too distracting.

Additionally, make it a habit to check out the FAST / SLOW section in the result screen.

If you are playing BISTROVER on the lightning model cabinet, the touch screen display has fine-grained breakdown of your timing information as well, if you tap on the "Player Analyze" menu.

## How do I fix my timing?

If your timing feels *significantly* off, you should fix your green number first before adjusting offset. If you feel the timing is slightly off, then you can fine-tune using the offset feature.

When you are calibrating your timing, play a chart that meets these criteria:

1. a song you are familiar with
1. a relatively easy chart, compared to your peak playing level
1. not heavy on scratches

Recommend songs:
* Element of SPADA (7/9)
* Fly Above (8)
* Shining World (8/9)
* DAYDREAMER (8/10)
* Mermaid Girl (8/10)

### Adjust your green number first

If you are getting too many FASTs, this is easily fixable! Consider reducing your green number (make notes go faster). The explanation for this is that, if have too much time to react to a note coming down, you may tend to hit too quickly. By reducing the green number, there will be a smaller window between the moment you read the notes and the moment you press the buttons.

If you are getting way too many SLOWs, you may not be having enough time to react. Increase your green number (make notes go slower) and see if it helps.

Lastly, don't use a green number that is too high or too low. When it is extremely low, you are playing purely on reaction speed, which has severe (negative) impact on timing. When it is extremely high, you are giving your brain too much time to process the notes, which leads to inconsistent timing. A typical GN range is between 260 and 300.

### Fix your offset last

[Use the offset setting in the blue menu to change your visual offset.](/beginner/option2#offset-adjustment)

Don't fiddle with this too much. Once you find a good offset for the environment you play on (particular arcade cabinet or your PC), try to keep the same offset for a while and see if you can get adjust to it.

## Other tips to improve timing

### Horizontal reading

**Horizontal reading is a very important topic that warrants an essay of its own**. [I recommend that you read this article](https://the-japari.tumblr.com/post/166760567060/horizontal-and-vertical-reading) and internalize it forever.

### Eyesight

Take some time to consider where on the screen you are looking. Ideally, your sight is fixed at one location on the screen; you should not be drifting up and down. If you can keep your reading to one area of the screen, your timing will improve.

### What about white number?

[Having a large lane cover (high white number) is not ideal, as it "compresses" the notes together](https://the-safari.com/3103), making it difficult to tell them apart. If you are playing with a white number higher than 500, you might want to experiment with making the lane cover shorter.

(There are valid reasons for very high white numbers -- one of them being playing on a display with severe ghosting problems, which can be remedied by a high WN. In that case... sorry, not much you can do there)

### Your conditions matter

This might seem obvious, but it does need to be called out. Some days, you are tired, so you hit a lot of SLOWs. Other days, you're hyped up on caffeine, so you hit a lot more FASTs thanks to your heightened reaction time. Since IIDX has a very tight timing window, this makes a lot more of a difference than you think! This doesn't directly help you with improving your timing, but it's something to keep in mind. Maybe your green number and offset are totally fine, maybe you're just a bit tired today.

## Recommendation from DJ SOMORI

This section is a translation from [this page](https://gall.dcinside.com/board/view/?id=rhythmgame_new1&no=82337&search_pos=-90001) by DJ SOMORI.

You should always be paying attention to your key taps and comparing to the song you are playing. This doesn't mean that you should be putting more power into your fingers to make a louder noise; you should instead try to make a louder key tap with the minimal movement and minimal force.

When you watch videos which play high-tier songs like 天空の夜明け or Verflucht Leggegendaria by ranked players, their key sounds sound almost like hand clap videos.

If you are able to make louder noise with very little movement and force, you are efficiently pressing the keys.

Next - stabilizing your sight line is also important. Some players who use a high white number for the purpose of stabilizing their focus. Unless you play soflan songs, your sight line must be fixed on one spot.

It is also important that you lower your green number first, before messing with the offset. If you lower the green number, you are reducing the amount of information your brain needs to process. As the result of this you may get a bit more SLOWs - at this point you can adjust the offset to compensate for this.

## Recommended songs for timing practice

This is a slightly older list, but a good list nonetheless. The number of stars indicate how helpful it is for your timing practice, and not its difficulty.

## [INF] Ensure your PC's audio latency isn't too high

If you are playing at home, you might first want to confirm that your audio output does not have a significant delay. A good way to check this is to use a [test video like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucZl6vQ_8Uo).

![inf audio settings](/assets/img/infinitas_audio.png)

Double check that you're using exclusive WASAPI setting and not shared mode -- this is configurable in the game's launcher. See the image above.

There are other ways to reduce audio latency on a Windows PC, but this page will not go into detail, since it is very hardware dependent. Just gotta search online for answers and experiment on your own.
