# Absolute Beginners

A section for absolute beginners who never even touched IIDX.

The goal of this section is for you to understand enough of the game to play a song.

Installing Infinitas or starting your first credit on a IIDX cab can be daunting. After reading this section, hopefully it won't be as scary!

There is a LOT of different things you will learn about the game along the way, but that's for later sections. Let's focus on the absolute basics for now.

After you play a couple dozen songs, when you feel comfortable and want to learn about the basics of the game - move onto the Beginners section.
