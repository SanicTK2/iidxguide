## Disclaimers

Updated May 2021.

This is a list of monitors that meet the following criteria:
* Native 120Hz+ panel and supports 120Hz input
* 39" diagonal or larger
* 16:9 aspect ratio
* flat, not curved

Features that do not affect IIDX or BMS simulators will not be explicitly called out; such as FreeSync, G-Sync, HDR, and so on.

There are also a **handful of TVs** that are small enough (less than 55") and support native 120Hz input; e.g., LG NANO85, Sony X90J, and so on. This is a rapidly growing segment especially in 2021 -- you should look for reviews on [rtings.com](https://rtings.com) instead. Make sure the size of TV you are buying actually uses a 120Hz panel - it is common for TV manufacturers to use 120Hz panels for larger sizes but only 60Hz for smaller sizes of the same model -- Samsung is the worst offender in this regard.

## Lightning Model display

For reference, [according to this page](https://land3939.info/mgame/1148), Lightning Model cabs use the following primary display:

* Manufactuer: [GTT](http://gtt.co.kr/en/?ckattempt=1)
* Model: TLK-4300
* 43" VA panel at native 1080p 120Hz.
* Cab uses 1600x900@120Hz over DisplayPort (the game is 720p however, so it's upscaled to 900p)
