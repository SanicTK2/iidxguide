## Main article

I do not love to write directions on how to play DP but it would be good to discuss the middle finger's movement. This article focuses on the right hand.

Tbh, the controversy on which is better, between Middle 5 and Middle 6, has not been around long, because many top DP players use Middle 6. It may be embarrassing given what I think, but I might be the only person who uses Middle 5 among rankers.

A long time ago, there were EZ2DJ players who used bizzare hand positions (like S24 / 135) but they could beat Messiah 333 HARD. Tbh, I considered a position like that to have more cons than pros, but that position works like a charm against denims.

In the same way, I think Middle 5 has more cons than pros.

One of the powerful factors which Middle 5 has however, is that it does not change the hand's shape well, but it takes quite a long time and a lot of effort to get used to it.

I have hit keys by bending my middle fingers downwards - since 2009. I had played SP with 1:1 position* and I HC'd all 12s except BSB. But, I felt my limitations and started to play DP. I have utilized bending my middle finger for 6 years. (I took a rest and had military duty, which took 5 years, but before I had begun to play IIDX, I played piano for 7 years.)

Anyways, I have used bending my middle finger because I got used to it, not just because it's good for DP.

( This position is well-known as "NongGiSa position" named after the player that used it, NongGiSa.)

But Middle 6 is different, I think there must be a reason for most top players using Middle 6. One of the cons to Middle 6 is how it affects the angle and center position of your hand, it creates a slight imbalance, but it doesn't affect it too much. You can check how it goes in C.C.'s streams. Once the angle gets turned, Middle can move to 6 naturally because it's longer than the ring finger, and the ring can press 5 easily because it's shorter than middle. This is a similar idea to 1048.

But while focusing on SEQUENCE CAT and playing it many times, I realized that the ring is the most important factor in DP.

You can move your index and thumb fingers easily, but you cannot move the ring finger well because its tendon is connected to the middle finger, so you cannot move the ring individually. Even pianists feel a pain in the ass because of the ring finger. Chopin composed Etude to raise 3 fingers (middle, ring, and pinky) independently.

The ring finger's independence makes your hand positions even more flexible. You can see an example like in ereter's vid (X-DEN, EX-HARD) even though it could be unnecessary to hit a 23 trill with just 1 finger like the ring finger on left hand, that makes his hands more flexible and able to allows him to try various hand positions more easily.

In conclusion, I think it's unnecessary to discuss which is better between Middle 5 and Middle 6. The stronger you make your ring finger, the wider your hand capabilities will be. After that, you can choose either Middle 5 or Middle 6 freely from your preferences.
