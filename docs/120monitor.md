## Notes

Updated December 2021.

This is a list of monitors that meet the following criteria:
* Native 120Hz+ panel and supports 120Hz input at 720p+.
* 40" diagonal or larger
* 16:9 aspect ratio
* flat, not curved

Features that do not affect IIDX or BMS simulators will not be explicitly called out; such as FreeSync, G-Sync, HDR, and so on.

Panels that support higher than 120Hz (e.g., 144Hz, 165Hz monitors) almost always support 120Hz, but in limited resolutions. You should consult the technical manual from the manufacturer's site to see the full list of supported resolution and refresh rate. Infinitas runs at 720p @ 120Hz.

It is recommended that you do **NOT** use the speakers on these monitors and TVs for playing IIDX or BMS. Same thing for plugging in headphones into the monitor / TV - not recommended. There are various reasons - audio over HDMI / DisplayPort may add significant latency, the DAC on the monitors may be picky about audio sample rate, TVs may have additional processing that may increase the latency, and so on. You should always try to have a separate low-latency audio source.

## Lightning Model display

For reference, [according to this page](https://land3939.info/mgame/1148), Lightning Model cabs use the following primary display:

* Manufactuer: [GTT](http://gtt.co.kr/en/?ckattempt=1)
* Model: TLK-4300
* 43" VA panel at native 1080p 120Hz.
* Cab boots into Windows at 1080p@120Hz, and then switches to 1600x900@120Hz when the game boots. DisplayPort cable is used.
* The game is still native 720p; it just gets upscaled. Presumably, the GPU scales the game from 720p to 900p full screen, and then the monitor upscales 900p to fit 1080p panel.

## TVs

There are also a handful of TVs that are small enough (less than 55") and support native 120Hz input; e.g.,
* Sony X85J
* Sony X90J
* LG NANO85
* LG 48CX (OLED)
* REGZA 43Z730X

... and so on. This is a rapidly growing segment especially in 2021 -- you should look for reviews on [rtings.com](https://rtings.com). Make sure the size of TV you are buying actually uses a 120Hz panel - it is common for TV manufacturers to use 120Hz panels for larger sizes but only 60Hz for smaller sizes of the same model -- Samsung is the worst offender in this regard.

It's also worth noting that most TVs use a glossy screen, while most monitors use a matte screen. While glossy screens look nicer, glare from other light sources can be distracting when playing IIDX.
